Build a database of sale prices to spot underpriced items

The project will initially consist of a script running in the cloud, which scrapes sold item data from ebay, and matches the item description to a videogame ID (or skips the item if it can't match it). The details of the sale, sale price being particularly important, will then be logged againstn the videogame ID, building up a trail of sales over time, allowing the user to calculate e.g. the average sale price of the item.
